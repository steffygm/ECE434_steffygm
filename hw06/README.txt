Blynk
    In the repo is leds.js
    If the pins are the same and the app is the same as described in the instructions, the code should respond to the Blynk app that was described in the instructions (Authentication key: e2ddc4998b8946a887cf6cdf1301fac0)

A slider
    the same app as above also implements a slider for a LED connected to pin P9_14.
    Note: I did not need to configure the pin in order for it to work on my device. if it doesn't work the pin may need configed to pwm vs gpio
