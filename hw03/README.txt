TMP101
    - config pins P9_21 & P9_22 to i2c, and properly connect a tmp101 to that i2c bus
    - run the shell script (temp_read.sh) on the BB to read the current temperature

Etch-a-sketch
    - config pins P9_21 & P9_22 to i2c, and properly connect a tmp101, and the LED matrix to that i2c bus
    - config pins P8_41, P8_42, P8_33, P8_35 to qep, and properly connect the rotary encoders to these two sets of pins
    - make the etch-a-sketch program (etch-a-sketch_3.py) executable and run it on the BB
    - heading up the tmp101 will clear the etch-a-sketch board
